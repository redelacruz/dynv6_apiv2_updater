# DynV6 API v2 Updater

Uses the REST API supplied by DynV6 to update zone records. Forked from [teunito/dynv6_apiv2_updater](https://github.com/teunito/dynv6_apiv2_updater), which is now 2 years without updates and buggy.

*Note: This is a work-in-progress project. There are a number of features and issues still on my to-do list. Future updates may break functionality. Use at your own risk.*

## Usage
`python3 dynv6-client.py --token "your_token" --interface "your_interface" record.zone.dynv6.net`

## Thanks
@[teunito](https://github.com/teunito) for the original code that was the basis and inspiration for this fork. (Please hit me up if you want me to merge this into your project via a pull request.)
